# FixMatch Implementation

This repository contains an implementation of FixMatch, a semi-supervised learning algorithm for image classification. It's based on the original FixMatch paper and adapted for use in Google Colab.

## Description

FixMatch is a semi-supervised learning method that leverages a combination of strong augmentations and consistency regularization to improve the performance of image classifiers trained with limited labeled data. It achieves state-of-the-art results on various image classification benchmarks.
